Framework of Template processor is complete - more functionality can be added as it is desired

Next Step is to flesh out the Utils/Configurator

The Configurator should be responsible for:



Flow is:

Parse Args
   get template type and name
      check if template exists
   if exists: process template file
      if not exists: handle error

   for file in preprocessor:
      check if already exists
      if not exists:
         no problem, make it
      if exists:
         if not specified by command line then:
            ask to overwrite || rename || skip
      if to be edited: edit
      if to be executed: execute then delete
      if nothing, do nothing


Utils needed based on this:
   fileExists()
   getFileType()
   makeFile()
   editFile()
   executeFile()
   deleteFile()
